# Question #1 Which game engine should I learn.

There are two answers to this question, the simple one and the more complex one. 

The simple answer is just learn Unity, lets go through the reasons. 

+ It's free

  When I say that I use Unity a lot of people respond saying that they cant afford it, to which I reply "!? ðŸ˜¢ have you actually been to the Unity site?!". Unity has two versions, the free version and the paid version. The free version has two main restrictions, it puts the unity logo at the start of your game, and your game cannot make more than $100,000, if it does you must buy a licence. I think thats a pretty damn good deal if you ask me! In fact I made a game using the free version and its now sold enough copies to warrant a paid licence and to be honest I'm so happy to give them that money, its money well spent.

+ It's easy to learn

  When chosing a game engine you're often weighing up ease of use against whats achieveable with that engine. There are a lot of engines out there that are very simple and claim to let you make games without having to write code, though this is probably true it's extermely likely that you will be restricted in whats possible to achieve in that angine. Unity may have a harder learnig curve but ballances that with an extremely wide scope of possibilities, Using unity you can make virtually any kind of game. 

+ There is a huge user base
  
  Don't underestimate how important this is. Because so many people use Unity virtually every question about it has been asked and answered making most questions a short google away.

+ The documentation is good

  People complain about the unity docs, I even complain about the unity docs, but this is mostly people making noise when they are just feeling frustrated. The Unity docs are great, they are not perfect, but making documentation is hard and considdering how big unity is its a mirriacle how good the docs are. Between the docs and forums you have all the information you will ever need. 

The complex answer is that no game engine is better than another, its about which one is better for what you are trying to achieve. Even thoug I'd reccomend Unity to *most* people I'm reccomending Unity based on the assumption that if you're reading this you are a beginner, if you dont know where to start Unity is definitley a great place to do so. 


# Which programming language should I learn

This is another super common question that people spend too much time focussing on. Arguing about which language is better is fun for a bit but ultimately fruitless; like game engines there is no *best* programming language, each one just has its pro's and cons.

The simple answer is to learn C#, it's a very expressive language and its the *best* langage that Unity uses. If you are tempted to use javascript in Unity go and hold your hand over a flame until the urge subsides and then learn C#, its faster and will save you a lot of time in the long run. 

In some cases you may already know a language, or you may want to learn a very specific one for a different project. Even if this is the case though it may be tempting don't try to find a game engine that uses that language just because you know it already, learn the best languag for the task at hand even if this means learning both. Having to learn multiple languages is a fact of life, and each time you do it it will ge easier, and you will become a better programmer in all the languages you know. Dont get me wrong, mastering a langue takes a long time and its worth doing, but dont be precious, learning new languages will get alot easier the more you do it.


# Where do you get your ideas

This is a really tricky one as its so personal but I have a few tips based on how *I* go about things:

+ Why you are making your game?

  This is the most important question to aks yourself, if you are making a game to teach yourself about making games then the number one most important thing is to keep your idea simple. 

+ Avoid thinking too much about story and characters at the beginning.
  
  Characters and stories are like mermaids trying to lure you to the rocks, they tempt you and convince you that bad adeas are good. It's *much* easier to work a compelling story into a game that you know is already fun to play than it is to turn a story in to a fun game. I've fallen to this trap so many times, and I'm sure I will do it again.

+ Break down other games you like and see what they are at their core. 

  Some games are very polished skins for a very simple idea, take something like rock band, its a very polished game about doing things in time with a rythm. You could take that kernal of an idea and represent it in a million other ways.

+ Find things in real life you enjoy doing.

  I made a game called Trick Shot that was inspired by throwing paper into a bin, at its core its simply a game about trying to throw a thing into another thing, whats interesting is how you represent that idea and how you extend it. There must be countless things you do that could make an equally simple game.

+ Make something perfect for your platform.

  Some things feel better on tablets and some things feel better on consoles. If you already know your platform think about which interactions feel good on it, for example if you're making a tablet game maybe think about what interactions a swipe would work well with?
