Intro
=====

This is a guide for *complete* beginners on making computer games. I've read many guides like this but none have clicked with me, it's not that the other guides have been bad but that sometimes you just need to find the right one for you. Try this one out and if its not right for you try another, you'll ge there eventually... I promise.

Everything in this guide is based on what I think, it's my very personal oppinion and should be taken as such. Ignore what you think is dumb and feel free to email me and tell you when you think it is, or perhaps write your own guide, the more inforomation that is out there more more chances the future me's and you's have of getting a head start.

You can read the guide however you like but I suggest this order:

FAQ
Ideas
Unity quick start
Google is your friend
Learning C#
Glossary

Good luck! and please let me know what you think - contacts below.
